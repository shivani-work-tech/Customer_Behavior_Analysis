Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project
 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading in Python to delivering business insights through SQL analysis, Power BI dashboards, and executive-level reports.
The objective of this project is to analyze customer shopping behavior, uncover trends and patterns, and present insights in a clear and actionable manner suitable for stakeholders.

📂 Dataset

Source: Customer Shopping Behavior Dataset (CSV)
Format: .csv
Records: Customer-level transaction data

Reporting: Power BI Reports, Gamma (PPT)
IDE / Tools: Jupyter Notebook, SQL Clients, Power BI Desktop

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)
Imported CSV data using Pandas
Performed initial inspection (head, info, describe)
Checked data types and structure

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed customer demographics and purchase patterns
Identified:
Popular product categories
Spending trends
Payment method distribution
Visualized trends using bar charts and histograms

3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Standardized column names
Corrected data types
Removed duplicates (if any)

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (Multiple Databases)
The cleaned dataset was loaded into:
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQL Server
Performed SQL queries to:
